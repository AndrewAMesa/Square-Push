This video game was created to learn React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The code in the program was created with the entity-control-boundary architecture pattern in mind to format the code. The entity objects are present in the Model folder, with the main entity being the model class itself within the Model.JS file. The boundary objects are both in the Boundary folder and within APP.js as the HTML elements at the bottom of the file. Finally, the controller objects are in APP.JS as controller methods.
